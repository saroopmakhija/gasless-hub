These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Samui Wallet mobile application ("the App"), provided by Samui ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

### 1. The Service

Samui Wallet is a noncustodial Solana wallet. The App allows you to create and manage your own Solana private keys, store them on your device, and interact with the Solana blockchain.

**You are in sole control of your private keys. We never have access to, receive, or store your private keys or recovery phrases.**

### 2. Your Responsibilities

- **Security:** You are solely responsible for securing and backing up your private keys and any recovery phrases. If you lose your private keys or recovery phrase, you will lose access to your digital assets. We cannot recover your keys or your funds.
- **Transactions:** You are solely responsible for all transactions you initiate through the App. All blockchain transactions are irreversible. We do not have the ability to reverse or refund any transaction.
- **Compliance:** You agree to use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You will not use the App for any illegal activity, including but not limited to money laundering or financing terrorism.

### 3. Assumption of Risk

You acknowledge and accept the following risks:

- **Experimental Software:** You acknowledge that the App is experimental software. You use it entirely at your own risk. The software may contain bugs, errors, or vulnerabilities, and may not function as expected or cease to function.
- **Financial Risk:** The value of digital assets is highly volatile. We are not responsible for any financial losses you may incur.
- **Protocol Risk:** The App interacts with the Solana network, a third-party protocol. We are not responsible for the operation, security, or functionality of the Solana network.
- **Third-Party Risk:** The App may be used to interact with third-party decentralized applications (dApps) or tokens. We are not responsible for your use of, or any losses incurred from, these third parties.

### 4. No Warranty

The App is experimental software provided "as-is" and "as-available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We explicitly disclaim all responsibility for the App. We do not warrant that the App will be error-free, secure, uninterrupted, or fit for any particular purpose.

### 5. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Samui or its developers be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind, or any other damages whatsoever, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App. We take no responsibility for any losses incurred. This includes, but is not limited to, losses from:

- Losing your private keys or recovery phrase.
- Transaction errors or failures.
- Software bugs, errors, viruses, or security vulnerabilities.
- Failures of the Solana network or third-party services.

### 6. Third-Party Services

The App may use or rely on third-party services, such as Cloudflare or public Solana RPC nodes. Your use of these services may be subject to their own terms and conditions.

### 7. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms within the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

### 8. Contact Us

If you have any questions about these Terms, you can contact us at: info [at] samui [dot] build.
