# Samui Wallet Public Roadmap

This roadmap shares what the Samui team is building now, what's next, and where the community can have outsized impact. It reflects current priorities and sequencing.

In addition, please take a look at our [open GitHub issues](https://github.com/samui-build/samui-wallet/issues).

**How to read this**

* **Now** = in flight or imminent.
* **Next** = queued after "Now," dependent on feedback/uptake.
* **Later** = larger bets or items gated on ecosystem maturity.
* Each item lists **Why**, **What**, **Status/Target**, **Issue/PR**, and **Community** (whether it's a good fit for external contributors).

**How to contribute**

* Pick a "Community" item below, then **open a GitHub Issue in this repo** with the title: `Roadmap: <item> — Contribution Proposal`.
* In your issue, include: goals, approach/design sketch, deliverables, estimated timeline, and how you'll demo/measure success.
* The Samui team will **review and offer consulting** (design feedback, API guidance, intros) so you can ship confidently.
* Docs are credibly neutral and community‑owned: contribute guides, templates, and examples to the GitBook repo → [https://github.com/murrlincoln/x402-gitbook](https://github.com/murrlincoln/x402-gitbook) (PRs welcome).
